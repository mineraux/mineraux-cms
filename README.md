# Custom CMS with React TS / Apollo / GraphQL

:construction: **In progress** :construction:

A website made with **React** (with _hooks_), **ApolloClient** and **Typescript**. <br/> Custom API with **GraphQL** and **MongoDB**.  
Special thanks to Omar Jbara and his [awesome react typescript apollo starter](https://github.com/Liinkiing/react-typescript-apollo-starter) !

## Code quality
I want to make this project as clean as possible with **unit tests**, **prehook commit**, **documentation**, **good accessibility** etc.

## Learning Apollo and unit testing
This is most of all a lab to learn Apollo, Jest, Typescript generic types, new Typescript features such as optional chaining.
